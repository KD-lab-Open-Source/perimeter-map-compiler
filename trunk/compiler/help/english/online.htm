<h1>Online Play</h1>
<p>Because Perimeter has not been designed for installation of new maps, one more step has to be done in order to enable it to play new maps online.</p>
<p>Perimeter Map Compiler distribution comes with a file named <span class="code">Perimeter.exe</span>. All you have to do is to go into the game folder, rename the file named <span class="code">Perimeter.exe</span> there to <span class="code">RealPerimeter.exe</span>, and copy the <span class="code">Perimeter.exe</span> from the Perimeter Map Compiler distribution there. That's all.</p>
<p>You do not have to know this, but if you are curious about what this accomplishes, it is this. The new <span class="code">Perimeter.exe</span> checks whether an internet connection is present. If it is, it downloads the list of existing maps, and synchronizes Perimeter with it. It then goes on to start <span class="code">RealPerimeter.exe</span> normally.</p>
<p>If you decide to install a patch for Perimeter, you have to reverse the steps, as the patch will likely not know of the switch. Remove the file <span class="code">Perimeter.exe</span> from the folder, and rename <span class="code">RealPerimeter.exe</span> back to <span class="code">Perimeter.exe</span> before installing the patch.</p>
