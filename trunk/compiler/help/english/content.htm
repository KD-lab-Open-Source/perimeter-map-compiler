<h1>Additional Content</h1>
<p>Perimeter Map Compiler supports some additional content for maps. Your can add a Hardness Map, a Zero Layer, a Surface Texture, a Sky texture, and 16-bit heightmap. To use the 16-bit heightmap support, simply convert the heightmap you use into a 16-bit grayscale format. The other content has to be turned on in the <span class="code">Project Settings</span> dialog. Note that additional content increases the size of the final Shrub, so do not include any content you do not use. Now, about each kind of content in detail.</p>
<h2>Hardness Map</h2>
<p>This is a black and white image. It is black in those areas in which the terrain cannot be modified by the player, and white in others.</p>
<h2>Zero Layer</h2>
<p>This is another black and white image. This time, black defines those areas that are terraformed when the game starts. Players can build on such areas right away.</p>
<h2>Surface Texture</h2>
<p>This is a small texture that is applied to terraformed terrain in the game. The default texture gives terrain the typical scratched look.</p>
<h2>Sky Texture</h2>
<p>This is the texture of the sky in the game. Even though normally you cannot look up while playing, the sky is reflected in powered zero layer.</p>
<h2>16-bit Heightmap</h2>
<p>This is a feature new to Perimeter Map Compiler 1.2. Normal, 8-bit, heightmaps allow you to work with only 255 height levels. 16-bit heightmaps give you 8191 level to work with. They allow you to define the shape of the map that much more precisely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no good free image editors with adequate 16-bit image support yet. The later versions of Corel PhotoPaint and Adobe Photoshop can handle them.</p>
