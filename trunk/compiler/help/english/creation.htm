<h1>Map Creation Overview</h1>
<p>The philosophy of the Perimeter Map Compiler dictates that it should not attempt to do things it can never do better than software created specifically for doing them. These things include texture and heightmap editing.</p>
<p>When you create a new project, Perimeter Map Compiler will create two images for you - <span class="code">texture.bmp</span> and <span class="code">heightmap.bmp</span>. The texture bitmap defines the colour of the map at each point. The heightmap bitmap is a grayscale image defining the height of the map at each point. Here, lighter means higher, darker means lower, and where the heightmap is black, land does not exist.</p>
<p>You can edit these images with any image editor you like. You can also use specialized texture and heightmap creation software, if you wish. If you do not have any of these, there are some free tools available:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a> is a capable open-source image editor.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/skencil/">Skencil</a> is an open-source vector drawing application. You can use it for design.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/">Terragen</a> is a terrain generator. With some plugins, the links to which you can find on its site, terrains can be exported as bitmaps.</li>
</ul></p>
