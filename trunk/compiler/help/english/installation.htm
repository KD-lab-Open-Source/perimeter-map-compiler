<p>Perimeter maps are destributed in files with the extension <span class="code">.shrub</span>. <a href="http://www.rul-clan.ru/main.php?page=56&lang=e">The Garden</a> at the site of clan RUL is one place where one can find some Shrubs to download.</p>
<h1>Preview And Installation</h1>
<p>To preview a Shrub, select <span class="code">Unpack Shrub</span> from the <span class="code">File</span> menu. This process may take a while, and when it is done, you will see the map in the Preview panel. If you like what you see, you can then install the map by selecting <span class="code">Install Map</span> from the <span class="code">File</span> menu.</p>
<p>Installation <em>does not</em> require a connection to the internet. All you need is to have Perimeter installed.</p>
