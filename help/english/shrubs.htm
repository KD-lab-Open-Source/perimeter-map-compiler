<h1>Project and Shrubs</h1>
<p>To start a new map you need to create a new project. Once you finish the project, you pack it into a Shrub - the file ready for distribution.</p>
<p>When working on a project, you can install it to see how it looks within the game. Only one project is installed at any one time, and generally, you cannot play it with other players online. An installed project has its name prefixed with <span class="code">[U]</span> in the in-game map list, to distinguish it from normal maps.</p>
<p>When you are done, and are sure that your map is perfect, you can pack it into a Shrub. This requires an internet connection, as the Shrub has to be registered online. This is required for synchronization between players during online play. Only a few bytes are sent during this registration. Absolutely no personal information is transmitted. You can register a map several times, but <em>only as long as you do not change it</em>. If you change it, you have to change its name before registering it again. This is to prevent existence of different maps of the same name.</p>
<p>The shrub you create contains all information about the map. You can install it, give it to a friend, or put it up for download. Clan RUL accepts Shrubs into its <a href="http://www.rul-clan.ru/main.php?page=56&lang=e">Garden</a>. Not all Shrubs are accepted, however, as a certain level of quality has to be met.</p>
